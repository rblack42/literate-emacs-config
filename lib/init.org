* Testing the Configuration

Unfortunately, actually testing the entire configuration defined in this file is beyond what can be done at this time. Instead, I will simply do some operational testing using GitHub/Actions. Here is the test file:

** GitHub Actions
:properties:
:custom_id: github-actions
:end:
#+begin_src shell :tangle .github/workflows/main.yml :mkdirp yes
name: testing literate emacs configuration
on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
        workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4

            - name: set up emacs
              uses: purcell/setup-emacs@master
              with:
                  version: 30.1
            - name: check linux environment
              run: |
                  pwd
                  ls
#+end_src
